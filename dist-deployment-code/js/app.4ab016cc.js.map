Die Vodafone Station ist schnell und einfach zu installieren. Einmal angeschlossen, müssen Sie nichts weiter tun. Der Router verfügt über eine vollautomatische Frequenzerkennung und scannt Ihre Umgebung nach der optimalen Funkfrequenz, um störende Einflüsse anderer Wlan-Access Points zu minimieren. Zudem unterstützt die Vodafone Station den aktuellen WLAN AC-Standard und bietet die Möglichkeit der parallelen Nutzung zweier Frequenzbänder (2,4 GHz und 5 GHz). Dies sorgt für sehr gute Bandbreite und Stabilität.<br><br>\\n                  In der Praxis können Sie so Übertragungsgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 400 Mbit/s erreichen.

Welche Auswirkungen hat das?\",\"answer\":\"Je mehr Geräte sich mit dem WLAN verbinden, desto größer ist der Datenaustausch und umso wichtiger ist eine hohe Bandbreite. Häufig werden im Hintergrund automatische Updates geladen, die der Nutzer gar nicht bemerkt. Bei einer geringen Bandbreite kommt es dann z.B. zu langen Seitenladezeiten oder zu Abbrüchen beim Videostreaming.

Dabei ist ein Byte in etwa das Achtfache eines Bits. Eine typische Internetverbindung (derzeit in Deutschland ~20 Megabit/s im Download) „schafft“ also genau 2,5 Megabyte pro Sekunde. Highspeed-Internetverbindungen von Unitymedia laden bis zu 125 Megabyte pro Sekunde (bei 1000 Mbit/s).\"\n          />\n          <faq-entry\n            question=\"Was ist das Besondere an der neuen Vodafone Station?\"\n            answer=\"Die Vodafone Station ist ein WLAN-Kabelrouter, der sowohl technisch als auch optisch die neuesten Qualitätsstandards erfüllt. Die Vodafone Station ist schnell und einfach zu installieren. Einmal angeschlossen, müssen Sie nichts weiter tun. Der Router verfügt über eine vollautomatische Frequenzerkennung und scannt Ihre Umgebung nach der optimalen Funkfrequenz, um störende Einflüsse anderer Wlan-Access Points zu minimieren. Zudem unterstützt die Vodafone Station den aktuellen WLAN AC-Standard und bietet die Möglichkeit der parallelen Nutzung zweier Frequenzbänder (2,4 GHz und 5 GHz). Dies sorgt für sehr gute Bandbreite und Stabilität.<br><br>\n                    In der Praxis können Sie so Übertragungsgeschwindigkeiten von bis zu 400 Mbit/s erreichen.

Welche Auswirkungen hat das?\"\n            answer=\"Je mehr Geräte sich mit dem WLAN verbinden, desto größer ist der Datenaustausch und umso wichtiger ist eine hohe Bandbreite. Häufig werden im Hintergrund automatische Updates geladen, die der Nutzer gar nicht bemerkt. Bei einer geringen Bandbreite kommt es dann z.B. zu langen Seitenladezeiten oder zu Abbrüchen beim Videostreaming. Die Qualität des WLAN und die Bandbreite sind deshalb entscheidend für eine gute und vor allem stabile Internetverbindung und ein ungestörtes Surfvergnügen. Unitymedia liefert mit allen Produkten Geräte, die die maximalen Bandbreiten auch beim WLAN unterstützen.\"\n          />\n          <faq-entry\n            question=\"Kann ich wirklich unbegrenzt surfen, oder gibt es eine Höchstgrenze für den Datenabruf?\"\n            answer=\"Wir garantieren einen faktisch unbegrenzten und ungedrosselten Datenaustausch mit unseren Servern.

Eine hohe Upload-Bandbreite lohnt sich aber für solche Nutzer, die regelmäßig große Datenmengen über das Internet versenden (z. B.

Allerdings kann bei Verwendung von Koaxialkabeln (Kabelnetz) die Leistungsgüte besser garantiert werden als bei der Verwendung von Telefonkabeln (DSL-Netz), da Koaxialkabel mehrfach umschirmt sind, und die Leitung somit viel weniger störanfällig ist.

Fast Ethernet Ports unterstützen lediglich Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 100 Mbit/s. Empfehlenswert ist ein Computer mit leistungsstarker Hardware und einem aktuellen (64Bit) Betriebssystem. Der verwendete Prozessor sollte über mindestens 2 Kerne mit einer Taktrate größer 2.8 GHz sowie schnellen Arbeitsspeicher mit mehr als 4 GB verfügen. Um die neue Speed-Klasse mit dem Smartphone oder Tablet optimal nutzen zu können, wird ein Gerät benötigt, das den WLAN AC Standard, idealerweise mit einer 4x4 MIMO Antenne, unterstützt.\"\n          />\n          <faq-entry\n            question=\"Welches Modem unterstützt die neue Speed-Klasse?\"\n            answer=\"Für Internet-Geschwindigkeit von bis zu 1.000 Mbit/s ist ein passendes Hochleistungsmodem erforderlich, das den Standard DOCSIS 3.1 unterstützt.

Dazu wird ein Powerline Adapter in eine Steckdose bei der FRITZ!Box gesteckt per Netzwerkkabel mit dieser verbunden. Der zweite Powerline Adapter mit integriertem WLAN wird dort in eine Steckdose gesteckt, wo Sie das zusätzliche WLAN Signal benötigen.</p>\n        <p>Auf diese Weise können größere Distanzen oder auch Etagen überbrückt werden, um WLAN auch in bisher unerreichbaren Ecken der Wohnung oder des Hauses verfügbar zu machen. Die erreichbare Geschwindigkeit hängt dabei von der Länge und Beschaffenheit der Stromleitungen sowie Störsignalen anderer elektrischer Geräte ab.</p>\n        <p>Der WLAN-Repeater hingegen wird mit dem WLAN-Funknetz der FRITZ!Box verbunden und stellt dann selber ein weiteres WLAN-Funknetz zur Verfügung, über das WLAN-Geräte auf Ihr Heimnetz zugreifen können. Das Signal des bestehenden Funknetzes wird vom WLAN-Repeater somit nicht verstärkt, sondern wiederholt (engl. \"repeated\").</p>\n        <p>Da der WLAN-Repeater mit dem Funknetz des WLAN-Routers verbunden ist, wird er an einer Stelle positioniert, an der er das WLAN-Signal des Routers in guter Qualität empfangen kann. Repeater eignen sich daher insbesondere, wenn geringere Abstände überbrückt werden sollen.</p>\n        <p>Hinweis: bei Repeatern spricht man häufig davon, dass die Bandbreite halbiert wird. Dies liegt daran, dass diese Repeater nur über eine einzelne Sende- und Empfangseinheit verfügen und das Senden und Empfangen von Daten nur nacheinander erfolgen kann. Da der FRITZ!Repeater 1750E zwei Sende- und Empfangseinheiten besitz und das Crossband Repeating unterstützt, trifft diese Aussage nicht zu.</p>\n      </faq-entry>\n      <faq-entry\n        question=\"Kann ich mehrere WLAN-Repeater einsetzen?\"\n      >Ja, mehrere WLAN-Repeater sind möglich. Entweder werden diese direkt mit der FRITZ!Box verbunden, um die Reichweite in verschiedene Richtungen zu erhöhen oder sie werden miteinander verbunden (WLAN-Reihenschaltung), um die Reichweite in eine bestimmte Richtung zu erhöhen.</faq-entry>\n      <faq-entry\n        question=\"Kann ich FRITZ!Repeater und FRITZ!Powerline kombinieren?\"\n      >Ja, Sie können das WLAN individuell mit beiden Zubehörgeräten erweitern und sie mit der intelligenten WLAN Mesh Technologie von AVM zu einem großen Heimnetz zusammenschließen</faq-entry>\n      <faq-entry question=\"An welcher Stelle positioniere ich einen WLAN-Repeater?\">\n        <p>Wenn der WLAN-Repeater über WLAN mit dem WLAN-Router verbunden ist, muss er sich innerhalb der Reichweite des WLAN-Funknetzes befinden, damit sich die beiden Funknetze überlappen. Da der WLAN-Repeater mit dem Funknetz des WLAN-Routers verbunden ist, wird er an einer Stelle positioniert, an der er das WLAN-Signal des Routers in guter Qualität empfangen kann.</p>\n        <p>Optimal ist eine Stelle, an der sich zwischen ihm, dem WLAN-Router und anderen WLAN-Geräten möglichst wenige Hindernisse befinden. Besonders metallische oder wasserhaltige Objekte, wie z.B. Heizungskörper, ein Kühlschrank oder auch Zimmerpflanzen, reduzieren die Qualität des WLAN-Signals deutlich. Ein WLAN-Repeater sollte zudem entfernt zu anderen Funksendern, wie z.B. einer Mikrowelle, einem Babyfon, Funklautsprechern oder Bluetooth-Geräten positioniert werden.</p>\n        <p>Im Betrieb als WLAN-Brücke lässt sich die Qualität der WLAN-Verbindung zwischen FRITZ!WLAN Repeater und FRITZ!Box an den Signalstärke-LEDs des Repeaters ablesen. Positionieren Sie den Repeater an einem Ort, an dem mindestens drei der fünf LEDs leuchten.</p>\n        <p>Hinweis: Sie können mit FRITZ!App WLAN ganz einfach den optimalen Ort für FRITZ!Repeater ermitteln.</p>\n      </faq-entry>\n      <faq-entry\n        question=\"Was sind die technischen Voraussetzungen und Grenzen zur Verwendung von Powerline?\"\n      >\n        <p>Powerline funktioniert in der Regel im gesamten Stromnetz eines Hauses / einer Wohnung, egal ob Alt- oder Neubau. Dabei muss es sich um ein zusammenhängendes Leitungsnetz handeln, zudem ist zu beachten, dass Leitungslängen von 300 Metern nicht überschritten werden können. Je länger die Leitungswege sind, desto geringer wird die erreichbare Bandbreite.</p>\n        <p>Unterschiedliche Phasen sind kein Hinderungsgrund Powerline zu verwenden. Sicherungskasten, FI-Schalter oder Stromzähler stellen zwar eine große Dämpfung für das Signal dar, blockieren es jedoch nicht in jedem Fall.</p>\n        <p>Die Verbindung zwischen den FRITZ!Powerline-Adaptern wird mit einem individuellen Kennwort (AES-128-Bit) verschlüsselt und ist damit vor dem Zugriff durch Unbefugte geschützt.</p>\n      </faq-entry>\n      <faq-entry question=\"Was ist WLAN Mesh?\">\n        <p>\n          <strong>Die zentralen Vorteile von WLAN Mesh sind:</strong>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong>Einfache Einrichtung per Tastendruck</strong>\n          <br />Die Einbindung eines neuen FRITZ!-Produktes ins Mesh ist kinderleicht: Einfach jeweils an der FRITZ!Box (Mesh Master) und dem neuen FRITZ!-Produkt die Connect- bzw.
